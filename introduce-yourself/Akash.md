Hi there, my name is Akash and I currently work as a Front-End Web Developer in the automotive marketing industry. Working on open-source projects allows myself to learn new concepts from others who have vast experience and knowledge of the subject. I started in HTML/CSS, and have since moved into React/Nodejs development. I enjoy bringing static projects to life using JavaScript and front-end frameworks!
